# Risk Reduction Report

## Project Information

- **Project Name: IH8 Development of Modern, Free and Open-Source Modeling Software**
- **Report Date: 30/10/2023**
- **Developer: Jan Steinhauer**

## Introduction

This risk reduction report has been prepared for the Development of Modern, Free and Open-Source Modeling Software to document the measures taken to mitigate risks associated with the processing of file inputs, specifically Comma Separated Values (CSV) files. Given that the handling of file inputs is a common vector for security vulnerabilities, this report outlines the risks identified, the mitigation strategies implemented, and the testing procedures in place to ensure the integrity and security of the CSV file processing within Development of Modern, Free and Open-Source Modeling Software.

## Identified Risks

The following risks have been identified with regards to handling CSV file inputs:

1. **Malformed File Input:** CSV files with incorrect format could lead to exceptions or unexpected behavior.
2. **Data Corruption:** Improper handling of file encoding and delimiters might lead to data corruption.
3. **Information Disclosure:** Improper parsing of CSV files may inadvertently expose sensitive information.

## Mitigation Strategies

### Input Validation

- **File Type Verification:** Implement checks to ensure only files with the ".csv" extension are processed.
- **Content Validation:** Enforce strict parsing rules to validate the structure and content of the CSV file against a predefined schema.

### Data Integrity

- **Encoding Standards:** Ensure consistent and correct handling of file encodings to prevent data corruption.
- **Delimiter Checking:** Robust parsing to handle various delimiters and newline characters.

### Testing and Monitoring

- **Automated Testing:** Implement automated tests to validate the functionality and security of the CSV parsing feature.
- **Monitoring:** Continuous monitoring for abnormal patterns in file uploads which could indicate an attempted attack.

## Testing Procedures

The following testing procedures have been established:

- **Unit Tests:** Validate individual functions for CSV processing
  
## Conclusion

The mitigation strategies and testing procedures outlined in this report are designed to address the identified risks associated with CSV file input handling in Development of Modern, Free and Open-Source Modeling Software. The ongoing risk assessment, coupled with regular updates to the software, will continue to enhance the security posture of the project.
